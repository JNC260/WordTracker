# Word Tracker

Word Tracker is my first Python app and is designed to help writers analyze text for over-used words. Running text through Word Tracker will alert users to word counts larger than 1% of the total word count, excluding the most commonly used words in the English language.

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository
2. Run wordTracker.py from the terminal of your machine or your favorite code editor.

3. Enter text to be analyzed in the graphical user interface that pops up.

Clicking "View Bar Graph" displays a bar graph of all words used with a frequency greater than 1% of the total word count. Users can see other commonly used words from there text here.

Clicking "View Pie Chart" displays a pie chart of all words used with a frequency greater than 1% of the total word count and provides another way for users to see which words occupy most of their text.

**Technology Used**: This app was created using Python, tkinter, and matplotlib in 3 days.

**Future Plans**: I would like to be able to suggest synonyms for the most used words as well as highlight where they appear in the text the user enters.  I would also like the option of uploading documents to be analyzed as well.
